        Is life a little boring? Fed up of the same old view out of the window?  It’s definitely time to try something new!  

        We have residential placements available at some well-loved hostels. City, country or coastal, the choice is yours! Our hostel/student placements are perfect if you would like to gain hospitality experience, complete a work placement as part of your course of study or simply get away from home and lend a hand.  
        
        Hostel Placement volunteers assist the team of staff with tasks including serving meals, housekeeping and reception.  Our friendly teams will give you a warm welcome and support you throughout your volunteering.  You don't need any experience - just enthusiasm and a willingness to get involved!  
        
        Best of all, in your free time you can visit the local attractions or explore the countryside near the hostel.
        
        Placements are for 2-8 weeks.  Accommodation is provided and travel expenses up to £105.
